# Trivia Game-Advanced - Rubik's Cubes
##### Homework Assignment 5: Advanced Assignment - Timed Questions

This is a fun and interactive trivia game that runs in your web browser, it is the Advanced Version of the Unit 5 Homework covering JavaScript & jQuery.  (The Basic Version can be found on my [Portfolio](https://sasquatchxyz.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/)).  The game was styled with Basic CSS (no templates), simply so that I could expand my practice.  I changed up the subject matter from the Basic Version to focus on one of my other hobbies, Rubik's Cubes... because let's face it... who doesn't love a good Cube...
